# Refunds

As a freelance developer, my goal is to provide high-quality service and meet the needs of my clients. If for any reason you are not satisfied with my work, please contact me so we can find a solution.

## Cancellations

If you decide to cancel a project before it is completed, you will be refunded 50% of the initial payment. If the project has already started and a significant amount of work has been completed, the refund will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Refunds

If you are not satisfied with the work I have done, please contact me so we can discuss your concerns. If after discussing the problem we cannot find a satisfactory solution, you will be refunded 50% of the initial payment.

## Exceptions

No refunds will be offered if the work has already been completed and satisfactory received to the client. Additionally, no refunds will be offered if the client changes their mind about the design or functionality of the project after the work has been completed.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about my refunds policy, please contact me through my email or telegram DM. I am here to help and ensure that you are satisfied with my work.
