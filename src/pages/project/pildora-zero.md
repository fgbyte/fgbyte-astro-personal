### Summary:
In this project focusing on contraceptive methods, I developed a landing page with a responsive and visually appealing layout. Employing relative design principles, I ensured that all elements were proportionally arranged. The highlight of this project lies in its use of JavaScript for conditional rendering. This dynamic functionality tailors the user experience, offering relevant information and interactive features.
