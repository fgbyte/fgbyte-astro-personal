In this project, I developed a commercial portfolio and catalog tailored to photographers and photo studios. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), the website is exceptionally fast-loading, offers auto image optimization, and follows an SEO-friendly architecture. What sets this project apart is its extensibility; it can seamlessly transform into a blog and an online store, providing a versatile online platform for photographers and studios. This project exemplifies my commitment to delivering visually appealing, high-performance web solutions for the photography industry.
