 I had the privilege of creating a visually engaging and highly functional website for a veterinary hospital. Leveraging a combination of HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, I meticulously designed and developed web layouts that not only reflect the professionalism and care associated with a veterinary hospital but also ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

 These web layouts are designed to be fully responsive, allowing pet owners to access vital information and services conveniently on a range of devices. To cater to the diverse needs of the veterinary hospital, I also integrated internal pages, offering a cohesive and informative journey for website visitors.

 One of the standout features of this project is the seamless integration of Google Maps, which enhances the website's functionality. It provides users with precise location information and directions, making it easier for pet owners to find and access the hospital's services.
